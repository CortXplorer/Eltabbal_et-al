# El Tabbal et al. 2020 "Removal of the extracellular matrix biases auditory cortical layer dynamics towards supragranular frequency integration"
 
A read me file for the code and data to reproduce the analysis done in the above mentioned paper
 
## Usage of the code and reproduction of figures: 

For running the code you will need to download the following data from the following link

After downloading all the files you need to download the MVGC_toolbox for granger causlaity script along with Chronux toolbox for oscillation analysis functions. 

These data are the CSD traces used for the analysis for raw LFP data kindly contact us so we can provide you with it.
